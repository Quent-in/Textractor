<a id="welcome-to-textractor-documentation" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-textractor-documentation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Textractor documentation</h3>

<p>Textractor is an OCR (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">optical character recognition</a>) application. It extracts text from images so that you can edit or save the text on a digital device.</p>

<p>Textractor is based on two third party libraries. The actual recognition is made with Google's <a href="https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">Tesseract OCR</a> engine. Some general image manipulation is done with <a href="http://www.leptonica.com/">Leptonica</a> image processing library before the image is passed to the Tesseract for recognition.</p>

<h3>
<a id="general-information" class="anchor" href="#general-information" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>General Information</h3>

<p>Upon first use, Textractor will prompt you to choose a language file. The selected file is then downloaded and installed on your device. After that you can start using Textractor. If you need more languages, just select and download them. Once a language file is downloaded, it does not need to be downloaded again.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: <em>Why I need to download the files separately?</em></p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: It is recommended by Jolla and by common sense that developers don't ship massive amounts of data files with the application. In this case the application size would have been over 200 MB if all the language files were embedded to the .rpm package.</p>

<h3>
<a id="settings" class="anchor" href="#settings" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Settings</h3>

<p>Textractor has some adjustable parameters which can improve the recognition results if adjusted correctly. The values are set as a default so that Textractor should work pretty good for most of the images. Most of the settings are rather advanced and I recommend to read instructions below if you want to adjust them. </p>
